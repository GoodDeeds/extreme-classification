Please go through the instructions in the main `README` about using these datasets. For Bibtex, Delicious and Mediamill, please remove the top line and run `./split_maker_small_dataset.sh` to get the appropriate split files. Please note that the training scripts are expected to run only run on these splits and not the original splits, which are merely indices.
